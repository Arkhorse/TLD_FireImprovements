# Fire Improvements for *The Long Dark*

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description

This game is a lot about managing resources. However, handling these resources is sometimes unnecessary hard or doesn't let you decide what to use at all. E.g. when you ignite a torch the game always uses the best matches which are better used for lighting fires. It always shows the best torch in radial menu although I want to use up the worst torch first or use the worst torch to throw at a stalking wolf, not the best. When starting a fire, why are the items sorted in such an odd way. Why can it not remember my last selection or automatically use burning torches as fire starter?
This mod is a configurable _quality of live_ mod all around fire that lets you add several features to improve your day. Including, remember last used fire item, better item sorting for fire starting, better torch/ flare support for fire starting, better torch usability outside of fire starting, configurable no-tinder penalty and no magic fire duration boost.

## Settings

There are several new settings in the *Mod Options*:

- Torches
  - Worst Torch in Radial

    _Shows the worst torch in the radial menu instead of the best._
  - Worst Matches to Light Torch

    _Uses the worst matches to light a torch instead of the best._
- Fire Starters
  - Sort by Igniting Chance

    _If you want to sort torches by the igniting chance during fire starting instead of sorting by their name._
  - Remember Last Fire Starter
  
    _If you want to automatically preselect the last used fire starter. Torches are excluded from this._
  - Always Sort Torches/ Flares To First

    _If you want to always sort burning torches/ flares to the first position regardless of the sorting order. This means torches are no longer in the usual sorting order for fire starters(e.g. sort after ignite chance)._

  - Always Select Torches/ Flares First

    _If you want to always select burning torches/ flares first regardless of the sorting position or the last selected fire starter._
- Tinder
  
    _Similar to fire starters._
  - Sort by Weight
  - Remember Last Tinder
  - Tinder Not Required Level

    _The level where tinder isn't required anymore. Won't get updated in the skill log page._
  - No Tinder Penalty

    _The fire start success penalty for using no tinder._
    - Penalty Level
      
      _This setting allows you to set a penalty multiplier per level below selected. E.g. if your current level is 3 and you chose level 5 your penalty will be (5 - 3) x selected penalty. If you are level 5 and select level 5 your penalty becomes 0._

- Fuel

    _Similar to fire starters._
  - Sort by Burn Duration
  - Sort by Igniting Chance

    _If you want to sort fuel by igniting chance. When burn duration sorting is also set to true fuel is sorted by igniting chance and by burn duration. Igniting chance has the higher priority._
  - Remember Last Fuel
- Accelerant

    _Similar to fire starters._
  - Remember Last Accelerant  
- Fire
  - No More Fire Duration Boost

    _Fire burns longer when the player is outside in the cold. It doesn't matter where the fire is. This disables this magical mechanic._
