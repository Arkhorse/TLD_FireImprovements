# Weapon Improvements for *The Long Dark*

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description

This game is a lot about managing resources. However, handling these resources is sometimes unnecessary hard or doesn't let you decide what to use at all. E.g. when you ignite a torch the game always uses the best matches which are better used for lighting fires. It always shows the best torch in radial menu although I want to use up the worst torch first or use the worst torch to throw at a stalking wolf, not the best. When starting a fire, why are the items sorted in such an odd way. Why can it not remember my last selection or automatically use burning torches as fire starter?
This mod is a configurable _quality of live_ mod all around fire that lets you add several features to improve your day. Including, remember last used fire item, better item sorting for fire starting, better torch/ flare support for fire starting and better torch usability outside of fire starting.

## Settings

There are a few new settings in the *Mod Options*:

- Torches
  - Worst Torch in Radial

  - Worst Matches to Light Torch

    _Uses the worst matches to light a torch instead of the best._
- Fire Starters
  - Sort by Igniting Chance

    _If you want to sort torches by the igniting chance during fire starting instead of sorting by their name._
  - Remember Last Fire Starter
  
    _If you want to automatically preselect the last used fire starter. Torches are excluded from this._
  - Always Sort Torches/ Flares To First

    _If you want to always sort burning torches/ flares to the first position regardless of the sorting order. This means torches are no longer in the usual sorting order for fire starters(e.g. sort after ignite chance)._
